# generator-AdaptiveCardTransformer

Yeoman generator for Adaptive Card Transformer. This generator will let you quickly set up an echo bot (generated by Microsoft Botbuilder) and plugins for use with the Adaptive Card Transformer.

## About

The `generator-AdaptiveCardTransformer` will help you scaffold plugins and an echo bot for use with the `Adaptive Card Transformer`. In order to use the `Adaptive Card Transformer`, you will need a bot. If you do not have a bot, you can create a new echo bot with `generator-AdaptiveCardTransformer`. After scafoolding the plugins and echo bot, the generator will prompt the user to integrate the `Adaptive Card Transformer` and plugins into the scaffolded echo bot. If you already have a bot, you will need to manually integrate the `Adaptive Card Transformer` into your bot. For manual integration, please refer to this [documentation](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/wd-bot/blob/main/docs/HowToIntegrate.md)
